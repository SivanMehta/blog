If there is no light shining on a mirror, it remains dark and cold. Maybe because
there are imperfections every mirror, or maybe because it internalizes some of the
light, the reflection is always *slightly* different form what you expect. You can
lie and cheat other people, and even yourself, but you can fabricate your own reflection.

A mirror doesn't produce it's own light. A mirror can return any look, send back
any glare, but it cannot invent on its own. It cannot create a highlight, it cannot
hide a blemish, but it can introduce a new perspective. Anyone can write a song,
draw a picture, or make a speech about you, but a mirror *has* to be honest; it
can only show you what you give it. Until you get to the funhouse.

When you get a distorted reflection at a funhouse, you know why. When your head
is suddenly the size of pumpkin, or when you suddenly sprout clown shoes, you know
why. Despite the illusion, you aren't disillusioned.

But what happens when you aren't in a funhouse? What happens when you see an image
you don't like, but still recognize? How do you react? You can get angry. Angry
at yourself, angry at your outfit, angry at your peers or anyone that brought
you here. ***Or*** you could laugh. Laugh at yourself, your effort, or your own
simple lack of surprise. But at the end of the day, you react to *something*. But
rarely, if ever do you react to the mirror.
